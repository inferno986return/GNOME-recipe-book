[R_Rosemary_Scalloped_Potatoes_by_erusan]
Name=Rosemary Scalloped Potatoes
Author=erusan
Description=A holiday twist on a classic American comfort food dish. Easy to make and sure to please.
Cuisine=american
Season=thanksgiving
Category=side
PrepTime=15 to 30 minutes
CookTime=More than an hour
Ingredients=5		Potato	\n1		Onion	\n1	oz	Cream cheese	\n1	cup	Half and half	\n1	cup	Parmesan cheese, grated	\n2	tbsp	Fresh rosemary	\n3		Green onions	\n1/2	tbsp	Salt	\n1/2	tsp	Pepper	\n1/2	tsp	Garlic	\n8	tbsp	Butter	
Instructions=Substitutions and conversions:\n5 potatoes = 5 cans sliced potatoes\n1 stick butter = 8 Tbsp butter\n4 cloves garlic = 1/2 tsp powdered garlic\n8 oz cream cheese = 1 pouch\n1 cup half and half = one small carton\n1 cup grated parmesan = 1 small bag\n\nPreheat oven to [temperature:350F].\n\nButter a 13x9 baking dish.\n\nInto buttered baking dish:\n- Add 5 thinly sliced (use a mandoline) russet potatoes, or 5 cans rinsed pre-sliced potatoes.\n- Salt and pepper potatoes (more will be added to creamy mixture later), stir lightly to separate slices.\n\nIn a frying pan on medium to medium-low heat:\n- Melt 1 stick of butter.\n- Add 1 chopped onion, garlic. Saute until translucent (about 5 minutes).\n- Add 8 oz cream cheese (quartered to help it melt faster).\n- When cream cheese is melted, add 1 cup half and half.\n- Add salt and pepper to taste. (Don't be afraid to use more salt than you expect — it's a large dish, and potatoes need flavoring.) Recommend 1/2 Tbsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper.\n- Add finely chopped fresh rosemary and chopped green onions.\n- Add 1/2 cup grated parmesan and melt into mixture.\n\nTo bake:\n- Pour mixture over potatoes, stirring a bit to help the sauce cover everywhere. If using canned potatoes, be sure to separate the slices which are otherwise stuck together and prevent the mixture from seeping in.\n- Spread remaining cheese over top to provide a nice texture and cheese flavoring.\n- Bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until liquid is bubbling and top cheese is browning.\n\nNote: Don't be afraid to use extra parmesan cheese and cream (half and half). This recipe makes just enough sauce, but extra creaminess never hurts, especially if you're using canned sliced potatoes. Garlic can be increased to taste, but be careful not to let the garlic overtake the rosemary.

[R_Borscht_by_sylvia]
Name=Borscht
Author=sylvia
Description=This is a traditional soup from East and Central Europe. There are an Ukrainian/Russian and a Polish version, but both a very similar so I put them together in a general recipe.
Cuisine=European
Season=winter
Category=Soups
PrepTime=15 to 30 minutes
CookTime=More than an hour
Ingredients=1	tsp	Peppers	\n200	g	Sour cream	\n1		Oil	\n1		Garlic	\n1		Tomato paste	\n1		Vinegar	\n1		Bay leaf	\n300	g	Carrot	\n100	g	Onion	\n500	g	Beetroot	\n750	g	Potato	\n1		Green Cabbage	\n1500	g	Meat and bones	
Instructions=[image:0]Over an open flame or under a broiler, roast 1 carrot and half of the onion until charred, about 3 minutes.\n\n[timer:00:08:00,Boil bones]Boil the bones in a large stockpot filled with water for 8 minutes, then drain and rinse thoroughly with cold water.\n\n[timer:02:00:00,Simmer]Clean the stockpot, then return the bones to the pot along with the charred carrot and half onion and the peppercorns. Add enough cold water to cover the bones by at least 1″, about 4 quarts. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer on medium-low until the meat easily separates from the bone, about 2 hours. Be sure to skim any foam or fat that accumulates on the surface. Add water to replace any that evaporates.\n\n[timer:00:45:00,Bake beets]As the bones simmer, preheat the oven to [temperature:375F]. Place the beets in aluminum foil, drizzle with the olive oil, and wrap tightly. Roast until easily pierced with a fork, 45-60 minutes. Remove from the oven, let cool, then slip off the skins and cut the beets into French fry-sized strips. Set aside.\n\n[image:0]When the bones are ready, strain the broth and discard the vegetables and peppercorns, then return the broth to the stockpot. Set the meaty bones aside to cool; once cool, pick apart the meat and set aside. Discard the bones or reserve for making stock.\n\n[image:0]Coarsely chop the remaining half onion and grate the other carrot. In a skillet, warm the butter on medium heat, then add the chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and tomato paste and sauté until aromatic, about 1 minute.\n\n[timer:00:10:00,Cook]Add the sautéed onion and garlic paste to the broth, along with the beets, red wine vinegar, and grated carrot. Bring to a simmer on medium heat, then add the shredded cabbage and cubed potatoes. Return to a simmer and cook for 10 more minutes, skimming any excess fat from the surface, then stir in the meat, parsley, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste, about 1/2 tsp. each.\n\n[image:0]Cover, remove from the heat, and allow to brew for 20 minutes. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and fresh dill sprinkled on top. For a more flavorful soup, allow the soup to brew overnight and reheat the next day.
Notes=It's easy to convert this soup in vegan or vegetarian by not adding the meat and cream.\nIt will lose a bit of personality though.\n\nIf you're in a hurry, use a canned broil as base and add around 600 g of chopped meat without bones, and follow the rest of instruccions. This way it will be ready in less than an hour.\n\nIngredients may vary. In example lemon juice instead of vinegar and ground or powder pepper instead of the peppercorns.

Instructions=If you haven't butchered the chicken, do so. Depending on how meaty you want the soup, you can use more or less of the butchered parts (I recommend the dark leg meat for the soup). Use the remaining parts for another dish.\n\nWash the celery, carrots and herbs. Slice the carrots and celery. Coarsely chop the onion. Prepare the herbs using kitchen twine in a bouquet garni.\n\n[timer:02:00:00]In a large pot, add the chicken, the stock, 2 carrots, 1 stalk of celery, the onion and the bouquet garni. Fill the pot with water to cover the chicken. Bring to a boil and simmer for at least 2 hours.\n\nUsing a cheese cloth strainer, strain the soup into another pot. Remove meat from the bones, gather any loose chicken and add it to the strained soup. Discard the bones and cooked vegetables.\n\nAdd the remaining carrots and celery to the soup. Bring to a boil and simmer for at least one hour. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n[timer:00:10:00]Add noodles and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the noodles are done.

[R_Gingered_Carrot_Soup_by_mwleeds]
Name=Gingered Carrot Soup
Author=mwleeds
Description=A nutritious vegan soup that can be made relatively quickly
Cuisine=
Season=winter
Category=entree
PrepTime=Less than 15 minutes
CookTime=15 to 30 minutes
Ingredients=2	lb	Carrot	\n4	cup	Water	\n1	tbsp	Olive oil, extra-virgin	\n1 ½	cup	Onion	\n2	tsp	Garlic	\n2	tbsp	Ginger, freshly grated	\n1	tsp	Salt	\n¼	tsp	Cumin	\n¼	tsp	Ground fennel	\n¼	tsp	Cinnamon	\n3	tbsp	Lemon juice	\n1	cup	Cashews, lightly toasted	
Instructions=Place carrots in large saucepan with water, cover, bring to a boil. Lower heat, simmer until very tender (10-15 minutes). While carrots are cooking, saute in olive oil all the onions, 5 minutes, then add garlic, ginger, salt, and spices. When all is well mingled, stir in lemon juice. Use food processor or blender to puree everything together (including all the toasted cashews). If you like a more textured soup, only half puree.\n\nGarnish with parsley, chives, mint or scallions if you want. Top with cayenne pepper if you want a spicier soup. You can also add any leftover grains like rice, barley, couscous, etc. at the last minute.\n\nThis is my Aunt Wendy's recipe.
